        <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
        <p>
          YouTube <br />
          <br />
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube.com</a>
          <br />
          <img
            src="/lesson2/images/fitts.png"

          />
          <br />
          Fitt's Law refers to the relationship between the size of a target,
          its distance from the user, and the time required to move to the
          target accurately. The more noticeable a button is and the closer
          together all the functions the user needs to access are, the better
          the experience and functionality of the webpage. I believe that
          YouTube exemplifies Fitt's law becuase everything a user needs to
          access while watching a video is there on the same screen with no
          scrolling required. The play/pause button, settings, autoplay, and
          timeline scrubber are large, noticeable, and easily clickable,
          allowing users to interact with them easily. These elements are
          strategically positioned at the bottom of the player, reducing the
          required cursor/finger movement.

      <div id="visualHierarchy" class="container">
        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
          Dropbox <br />
          <br />
          <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">dropbox.com</a>
          <br />
          <img
            src="/lesson2/images/visualhierarchy.png"
            alt="a picture of the Dropbox.com main webpage."
          />
          <br />
          Visual hierarchy is one of the most important design principle in my
          opinion becuase it helps guide the user's attention and priorities on
          a webpage. Start with the most important things being the most visable
          so that the user moves their eyes and attention according to the size
          of the headlines or the buttons which should be arranged from most
          important to least important. I believe that Dropbox exemplifies this
          principle on their webpage becuase the user's attention starts with
          the largest headline which informs them of the 700 million user
          community that backs the company and trusts them. The next thing they
          notice is the button to sign up which informs them that the service is
          free, followed by the smaller text inbetween the button and headline
          that describes other benefits and perks of Dropbox.

      <div id="contrast" class="container">
        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>
          Apple <br />
          <br />
          <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a> <br />
          <img
            src="/lesson2/images/contrast.png"
            alt="A picture of the Apple.com main webpage."
          />
          <br />
          Contrast is another key principle of web design. It focuses on
          creating visual differences between elements to make them stand out
          more to the user. Apple utilizes this principle well by using a black
          background with white lettering, then switching to a white background
          with black lettering. Users also can't help but notice the sharp
          purple, yellow, red, and blue colors of the iPhones in the pictures.
          It creates a great modern style and draws attention to everything on
          the page through color.
